# IDS-703-Final-Project


This repository contains code files and reference for the final project in text analysis. The objective of this project was two fold:

1.	Can we predict the popularity of a Ted Talk just using the content from a transcript?
2.	Can we use a Neural Net to for a basic transcript for a Ted Talk?


The Kaggle notebook to run the model for the first question can be viewed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/srishti280992/tedtalks-data-project).
